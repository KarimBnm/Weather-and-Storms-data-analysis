Exploration of the NOAA storm database which can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).
Documentation about the data is [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf).

This analysis covers two questions :
- Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
